            Diwali is a five-day festival, the height of which is celebrated on
            the third day coinciding with the darkest night of the lunar month.
            During the festival, Hindus, Jains and Sikhs illuminate their homes,
            temples and work spaces with diyas, candles and lanterns[14] Hindus,
            in particular, have a ritual oil bath at dawn on each day of the
            festival.[107] Diwali is also marked with fireworks and the
            decoration of floors with rangoli designs, and other parts of the
            house with jhalars. Food is a major focus with families partaking in
            feasts and sharing mithai.[43] The festival is an annual homecoming
            and bonding period not only for families,[41][108] but also for
            communities and associations, particularly those in urban areas,
            which will organise activities, events and gatherings.[109][110]
            Many towns organise community parades and fairs with parades or
            music and dance performances in parks.[111] Some Hindus, Jains and
            Sikhs will send Diwali greeting cards to family near and far during
            the festive season, occasionally with boxes of Indian confectionery.

          <p class="rp3">
            The Diwali festival is likely a fusion of harvest festivals in
            ancient India.[49] It is mentioned in Sanskrit texts such as the
            Padma Purana and the Skanda Purana both of which were completed in
            the second half of the 1st millennium CE. The diyas (lamps) are
            mentioned in Skanda Kishore Purana as symbolising parts of the sun,
            describing it as the cosmic giver of light and energy to all life
            and which seasonally transitions in the Hindu calendar month of
            Kartik.[40][54] King Harsha refers to Deepavali, in the 7th century
            Sanskrit play Nagananda, as Dīpapratipadotsava (dīpa = light,
            pratipadā = first day, utsava = festival), where lamps were lit and
            newly engaged brides and grooms received gifts.[55][56] Rajasekhara
            referred to Deepavali as Dipamalika in his 9th century Kavyamimamsa,
            wherein he mentions the tradition of homes being whitewashed and oil
            lamps decorated homes, streets and markets in the night.

          <p class="p4">
            Diyas symbolise goodness and purity, and lighting them denotes
            dispelling darkness and going into light. And since Deepavali is
            celebrated on the new moon day, a time of darkness everywhere; light
            these lamps are a means to get rid of darkness. Lighting the lamps
            also denotes dispelling angerm greed and other vices

            best. In my last job, this passion led me to challenge myself daily
            and learn new skills that helped me to do better work. For example,
            I taught myself how to use Photoshop to improve the quality of our
            photos and graphics. I soon became the go-to person for any design
            needs.
